\subsection{Candidate selection and invariant distributions}
\label{subsec:invMassValidation}

- Ds/Lc in pp MC: invariant mass from task, invariant mass from bit, invariant mass from pandas applying standard cuts

The same selections used in~\cite{Acharya:2019mgn} were applied.}

\subsection{Efficiency}
\label{subsec:effValidation}

- Comparison efficiency from the package and RecoPID/GenLimAcc from correction framework

The same selections used in~\cite{Acharya:2019mgn} were applied.}

\subsection{Normalisation}
\label{subsec:normValidation}

The number of events used to compute the integrated luminosity, which enters in the calculation of the cross section, calculated by the new framework is compared to the number obtained from AliNormalizationCounter (PWGHF/vertexingHF/AliNormalizationCounter.h). The number of events selected by AliRDHFCuts::IsEventSelected is corrected to take into account the events for which the primary vertex is not reconstructed and $|z_{vtx}|<10$~cm.
