\section{Analysis package validation}
\label{sec:validation}

\subsection{Candidate selection and invariant distributions}
\label{subsec:invMassValidation}

- Ds/Lc in pp MC: invariant mass from task, invariant mass from bit, invariant mass from pandas applying standard cuts
- Lc in PbPb 2015 from TreeCreator compared to Lc published (raw signal per event)

\subsection{Efficiency}
\label{subsec:effValidation}

- Comparison efficiency from the package and RecoPID/GenLimAcc from correction framework

\subsection{Normalisation}
\label{subsec:normValidation}

- Ds in pp (running Tree Creator and std task in the same train)
- Lc in PbPb comparison of the events for normalisation/event selected from TTree and from task
